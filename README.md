# VANSIBLE
**The aim of this project is to provide developers with a fast and uncomplicated development environment.**
**For this, Vagrant and Ansible will be used in combination to provide various virtual machines with different software.**
**Developers should be able to do all their settings in a central configuration file.**

## Usage
### Software Requirements
* Linux or MacOs
* [Vagrant]
* [Ansible]
* [VirtualBox]
* [git]
* [python2.7]
* [pyaml]
* [sshfs]

### Installation
```
$ cd DESTINATION_FOLDER
$ git clone https://github.com/daniwe4/vansible.git
$ cd Vansible
```
### Configuration
For the first time installation use the template config file 'default.yml' in the main folder. 
Edit it and copy it to 'group_vars/all/config.yml'.
Each section is well commentet. Feel free to update each section for your own needs.

### First Start
The first start has to be with root priviliges. It will create a symlink, so from now on you only need the command "vag".
```
$ sudo ./vag.py
```

### Next Starts
For all following commands sudo is unnecessary.
If there is only one vm managed by vansible you donÂ´t have to specify the machine name.

Start or Install machines:
```
$ vag up <your_machinename>
```
Stop machines:
````
$ vag halt <your_machinename>
````
Update machines after editing ansible files:
````
$ vag provision <your_machinename>
````
Destroy machines:
````
$ vag destroy <your_machinename>
````

### Access To The Machine

To access to the console of the virtual machine you can use the following command:
````
$ vag ssh <your_machinename>
````
To access the folder structure of the virtual machines i suggest to use sshfs.
````
$ sshfs root@<vm_ip_address>:/home/vagrant/ <mount_dir_on_host>
````
